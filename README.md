# JobBoard

This project is an open source Job Board. It's primary purpose is to serve as a
training exercise.

## Requirements

* Docker

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:MattGibney/JobBoard.git`
2. cd into repo
3. Start service `docker-compose up`

## Frontend

The front end of this application is currently rendered serverside using
Handlebars templates. This may change in the future with a migration to a
separate front end architecture, that's a little over kill for now though. Front
end uses [Bootstrap 5](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) beta.
